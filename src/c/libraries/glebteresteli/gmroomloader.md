GMRoomLoader is an open source GameMaker library designed to streamline room loading at runtime. It provides methods to process the data returned by [room_get_info()](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Rooms/room_get_info.htm), use it to load rooms efficiently during gameplay, and clean up created elements when needed.
