Sprite combinator allows easy layer combinations and alterations for sprites creations and variants! All from your browser!

Mix Mouths, eyes, hairs, accessories or any sprites and images and obtain all the possible resulting sprite combinations! Perfect for VN character emotes or mix and match parts for NPCs, among many things.

Sprite combinator makes character variants easy!
1- import or drop your images for layers.
2-Arrange the layers order, positions and colors as desired.
3-Preview (right tab) and/or download the resulting sprite combinations

Also features useful little tools such as: image randomization (get a random combination of all layers), color linkage (link layer colors - say hair parts and beard), color modes (hue shift, or overlay), image offsets (adjust a specific subimage precise position) and many others!
