Over the last three years, the GameMaker Kitchen Discord has been growing slowly. To the point (as of writing) that we now have 1,616 members. This website has been made to allow further access to GameMaker Kitchen and it's incredible amount of libraries, tools, assets, etc. Without having to directly join the Discord server, but also preserving some history. Take a look around, we've got plenty here!

GameMaker Kitchen originally started out as a server for Juju Adams FOSS libraries. Over the years the server has shaped from being about Jujus libraries to a FOSS-focused GameMaker server as a whole. The server ownership was transferred over to TabularElf as of late November 2023.
