Crochet is a node-based dialogue editor forked from [YarnEditor](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnEditor). It is designed to output Yarn files using Yarn Script (specifically the upcoming 2.0 specification), a narrative scripting language for writing interactive dialogue in games. Yarn Script has been used in games such as [A Short Hike](https://adamgryu.itch.io/a-short-hike), [Far From Noise](https://www.georgebatchelor.com/farfromnoise), [Knights and Bikes](https://foamswordgames.com/#knights), and [Night In The Woods](http://www.nightinthewoods.com/). The Yarn language is designed to be simple and easy to understand, even if you don't have any programming experience. This makes it a great tool for both writers and programmers alike.
