Gobo is an opinionated formatter for GameMaker Language. It enforces a consistent style by parsing and re-printing your code with its own rules, taking maximum line length into account.

By using Gobo, you agree to cede control over the nitty-gritty details of formatting. In return, Gobo gives you speed, determinism, and smaller git diffs. End style debates with your team and save mental energy for what's important!

Gobo provides a few basic formatting options and has no plans to add more. It follows the [Option Philosophy](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html) of Prettier.
