Not so much Frontend (GameMaker) related, but maybe interesting for your backend/database, if you have your own server running and need a robust, secure and professional data modelling.

Full documentation is available here:

There are tools out there that offer less functionality, but cost hundreds, some even over 1k $$$. I can not give away this for free, but I decided to set a low "community price", with the additional benefit of having the authour here at hand, so you can ask me anything anytime, even request new features ðŸ˜‰ (without a promise, that they will be implemented, but I will listen)

Yours,
Gris
