AseSync is originally an [open-source](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools/AseSync23) CLI tool by YellowAfterLife.

It automatically updates sprites in your GameMaker Studio 2.3+ project when the matching Aseprite file is changed on disk.

In some way, it can be seen as a successor to [lazyload](https://lazyeye.itch.io/lazyload). The GUI definitely took some inspiration from it.
