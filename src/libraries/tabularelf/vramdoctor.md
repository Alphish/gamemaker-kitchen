Vram Doctor was designed originally as a small debugging vram data tool directly within GameMaker, to allow one to know how much vram is being taken up by their projects resources.

# Features
- Automatic addition and removal of on the fly sprites, fonts, vertex buffers and surfaces.
- Very accurate estimations of texture page vram allocation.
- Automatic `application_surface` tracking.
- Texture group export awareness.
- Ability to adjust or completely shut off Vram Doctor automatic tick system.
