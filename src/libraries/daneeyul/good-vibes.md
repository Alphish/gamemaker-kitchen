This is a GameMaker Studio 2 plugin for device vibration! This plugin allows for simple or complex timed vibrations.

Normally, GameMaker will just vibrate a gamepad until you manually turn it off; this plugin handles that for you. You can set the duration of the vibration in frames independently for left and right motors.

This plugin also can make use of animation curves to allow for complex vibration patterns. Included are some sample patterns, including linear fadein, fadeout, panning between motors, and square wave pulses.
