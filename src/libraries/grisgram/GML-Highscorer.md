## Here's what it can look like
This screenshot is taken from the demo program contained in the repository. 
Just open the project in GameMaker Studio and hit F5, so you can play around with the settings and take a closer look in the room, where variables are set for the renderers.<br/>
* Date and Time format are localized based on the device settings!
* Columns can be turned on/off at will
* Colors can be changed
* Supports 3-999 Ranks (likely more, but I tested only up to 999)
