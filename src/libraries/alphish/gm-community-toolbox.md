For a while, I wanted to have some bloat-free package of utility functions. One that can just be plugged into the project without any setup whatsoever, and doesn't require reading more than typical GML manual page's worth to get started at all.

With the help of GameMaker devs (especially FrostyCat), I finally released...

# GameMaker Community Toolbox
The Community Toolbox has a collection of plain old GML functions for various purposes, like lerp/approach maths, JSON saving/loading, array operations and more!

Current release YYMPS (23.4.0): https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/blob/main/Releases/CommunityToolbox.23.4.0.yymps?raw=1
GitHub repo: https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/tree/main
Issues/feature requests page: https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues
GMC thread: https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/gamemaker-community-toolbox-project.103966/

Feel free to suggest features for the package (as long as they can be kept to plain old GML functions), or upvote the existing suggestions!
