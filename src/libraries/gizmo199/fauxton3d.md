Fauxton 3D is a powerful and efficient sprite stacking framework that not only makes 3D games possible in Game Maker but also INSANELY easy! There are many hurdles when attempting to do 3D rendering in Game Maker and it can be daunting trying to learn it all, but with Fauxton, I have tried to design it so that it is efficient, quick, and easy. So easy that a complete beginner to 3D can have a scene up and running in no time at all!
