JenScripts is a GameMaker Studio 2 library designed for rapid prototyping and development of procedurally generated levels. It contains over 60 iterative functions that can be combined with flexible parameters to create varied terrain. JenScripts supports geometric shapes, randomized distributions, and other algorithms to produce a limitless variety of patterns within a 2D grid. The grid can then be interpreted as object indices or tilemap data to convert into terrain in your room.
