runtime autotiling for gamemaker that comes in blob, edge, and corner wang tile flavors
how damn cool are tiles, right? you can use them for pretty much everything in game development. levels, storing big data, procedurally generating yerself a gf. whatever cool thing you want to do, you can and probably use tiles or tileable data to do it.

long story short: gamemaker does not have runtime auto tiling. it has autotiling for 16-tile corner adjacent tiles and 47-tile blob adjacent tiles in the room editor. but not at runtime! and no tile mutation! and no 16-tile edge ajacent autotiling at all! well runtile is to those problems what wu tang is to the children.
