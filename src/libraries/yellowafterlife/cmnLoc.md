It's easy to use and does a variety of cool tricks:

* It has [short](https://yal.cc/docs/gm/cmn_loc/#cmn_loc_get) (with option for extra-short) syntax  
    With a single-variable setup, "Start" can become L("Start") and that's all it takes to get it localized.
* You can keep your "default language" (e.g. English) in the source code if you prefer.
* Has support for template insertions (L("Volume: {0}%", vol))
* Has support for [ICU messages](https://yal.cc/docs/gm/cmn_loc/#icu) and pluralization  
    (no more "message(s)" for non-English)
* [Auto-generates](https://yal.cc/docs/gm/cmn_loc/#gen) files for translation from the source code.  
    Multiple formats; command-line and web-based tools.
* Loads translations [from multiple formats](https://yal.cc/docs/gm/cmn_loc/#load), easy to add your own.
* Crowdin-compatible import/export options for "public" localization.
