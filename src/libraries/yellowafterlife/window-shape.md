This extension lets you use custom window shapes in your GameMaker projects!

Ellipses, rectangles, polygons, complex shapes - anything goes.

Good for software, virtual pets, or more novel game ideas
(e.g. [BLAWK](https://im-a-good-boye.itch.io/blawk) used my [Desktop Screenshots](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-display-screenshot) extension to make a "hole" in a game window, but now you can have a real, click-through hole).
