Has your game ever crashed your device because it used too much memory?

This is the ultimate solution for asynchronous loading and saving (withou freezing the game). Must-needed for resource-intensive games (or if you want to optimize your game's memory usage in general).

With Managix, load only what is needed in each room, such as texture pages, audio groups, particles, buffers (3D models, etc)

Supports saving/loading buffers to console slots, plus several super useful features. [Check it all out here](https://foxyofjungle.itch.io/managix).
