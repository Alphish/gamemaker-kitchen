The largest collection of useful general GML functions (Math, AI, Linear Algebra, Arrays, Structs, Strings, File Search, Paths, Conversions etc)

The purpose of this library is to contain functions for common use, aimed at game development. So it was made thinking about being used in its entirety, rather than in parts.

At some point you will use the functions, although their existence or not will not affect your project. After all, the library is only a few kb! :D

Lately, I import it in all my new game projects! ðŸ”¥

There's a lot of cool and useful stuff! [Check it all out here](https://github.com/FoxyOfJungle/TurboGML).
